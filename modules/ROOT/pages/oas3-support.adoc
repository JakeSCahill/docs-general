Phase 1 of the support for OAS 3.0 is included in Anypoint Exchange, API Community Manager, and API Designer. You can catalog existing OAS 3.0 API specifications to enable partner and customer collaboration scenarios. You can also create and edit API specifications in OAS 3.

Perhaps the most important aspect of this beta support is that it lets you publish OAS 3.0 specifications to your API community, so that you can share them with partners and customers to help drive their adoption.

If you want to implement or deploy API specifications written in OAS 3.0, however, during this beta you must first convert them to RAML or OAS 2.

== Beta Features in Anypoint Exchange

* Publish an existing OAS 3.0 API specification.
+
On the *Publish a new asset* page, select *REST API - OAS* in the *Asset type* field.
* Share OAS 3.0 API specifications.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to share an OAS 3.0 API specification as OAS 2, download your OAS 3.0 API specification from Anypoint Exchange as-is, and then convert it to OAS 2.0 by using a tool such as APIMatic transformer.
====

* View documentation that is written into OAS 3.0 API specifications.
* Publish OAS 3.0 API specifications to API Community Manager.
* Download OAS 3.0 API specifications as RAML API specifications for scaffolding and implementation with 3rd party IDEs.
+
To make an OAS 3.0 API specification available for downloading as RAML from Anypoint Exchange for use in Anypoint Studio and API Manager:
+
. Import the OAS 3.0 API specification into API Designer.
. Click the three dots next to the filename in the *Files* pane and select *Duplicate*.
. In the *Duplicate As* dialog, select *RAML*.
