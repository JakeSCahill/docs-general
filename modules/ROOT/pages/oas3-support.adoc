Phase 1 of the support for OAS 3.0 is included in Anypoint Exchange, API Community Manager, and API Designer.

Perhaps the most important aspect of this beta support is that it lets you publish OAS 3 specifications to your API community, so that you can share them with partners and customers to help drive their adoption.

If you want to implement or deploy API specifications written in OAS 3, however, during this beta you must first convert them to RAML or OAS 2.

== Beta Features in Anypoint Exchange

* Publish an existing OAS 3 specification.
+
On the *Publish a new asset* page, select *REST API - OAS* in the *Asset type* field.
* Share OAS 3 specifications.
* View documentation that is written into OAS 3 specifications.
* Publish OAS 3 specifications to Anypoint Community Manager.
* Share OAS 3 specifications as RAML specifications with Anypoint Studio and API Manager.
